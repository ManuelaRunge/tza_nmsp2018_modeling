# Sub-national tailoring of malaria interventions in Mainland Tanzania: simulation of the impact of strata-specific intervention combinations using modelling
This repository includes the postprocessing and plotting scripts for the analysis of intervention simulations run for Tanzania in 2018.
Simulation data will be made available on Zenodo ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5701550](https://zenodo.org/record/5701550#.Yjc-3ahKi5g)).

The work has been published in Malaria Journal  [(https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-022-04099-5)](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-022-04099-5)
